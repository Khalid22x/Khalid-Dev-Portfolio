                    <div class="article-content">
                        <p>Welcome! For my graduation project, I dove into the fascinating field of Artificial
                            Intelligence to build a real-time object detection system. Computer vision is a critical
                            branch of technology that allows machines to process images and identify objects within
                            them, much like humans do. My project focused on creating a system capable of detecting
                            objects like people and cars in digital images and videos. </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            "Object detection has widespread applications across various fields of computer vision,
                            making it a prominent area of research in artificial intelligence."
                        </blockquote>

                        <h2>The Motivation: Why This Project?</h2>
                        <p>My primary motivation was an intense passion for learning artificial intelligence techniques.
                            While researching the topic, I noticed several gaps in existing applications: many had a
                            poor Graphical User Interface (GUI), some were slow and lacked accuracy, and most paid
                            applications were not available for mobile. This inspired me to create a system that was not
                            only functional but also efficient and user-friendly.</p>

                        <h2>My Objectives and Scope</h2>
                        <p>The main goal was to create a real-time object discovery system that is compact and efficient
                            enough to run on various devices. To achieve this, the project scope included several key
                            aims:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implementing a small and fast object detection model. </li>
                            <li>Creating an object dataset and using it to train the model. </li>
                            <li>Validating and analyzing techniques to improve both the accuracy and speed of the
                                detection model. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>The Technology Stack</h2>
                        <p>Building this system required a combination of powerful libraries for both the AI model and
                            the user-facing website. </p>

                        <h3>For the Model:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>OpenCV-Python</li>
                            <li>Tensorflow</li>
                            <li>Numpy</li>
                            <li>Pillow</li>
                            <li>Matplotlib</li>
                            <li>Easydict</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>For the Website:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Flask</li>
                            <li>Jinja2</li>
                            <li>Gunicorn</li>
                            <li>Werkzeug</li>
                            <li>Click</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>The Process: From Concept to Classifier</h2>
                        <p>The project followed a structured plan. The core workflow involved loading the object
                            detection data, performing image preprocessing, and then using that data to generate and
                            train the object detector classifier. Once trained, the classifier was serialized and saved
                            so it could be loaded and applied to new test data from images, videos, or a live camera
                            stream. The system was designed to allow a user to load an image or open a camera to detect
                            objects in real-time. </p>
                        <p>Below is a screenshot of the web application successfully identifying objects in an uploaded
                            image. </p>
                        <img src="../images/object-detection-image-2 (2).png"
                            alt="The web application interface showing an image with multiple detected objects like people and chairs."
                            class="blog-banner-image">

                        <h2>Putting the Model to the Test</h2>
                        <p>I conducted several tests to validate the model's effectiveness under different
                            circumstances. The model performed effectively when detecting objects in standard pictures,
                            videos, and even in real-time via a camera feed. It also succeeded in detecting objects in
                            black and white photos. </p>
                        <p>However, one key learning experience came from a test case that was marked "Ineffective": the
                            model struggled with detecting objects in pictures taken from a great distance. This
                            highlighted a clear area for future improvement and a deeper understanding of the model's
                            limitations.</p>

                        <h2>Future Plans and Enhancements</h2>
                        <p>This project serves as a strong foundation, and I have several ideas for future work to make
                            it even more robust and versatile. My plans include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Developing a mobile app version of the application. </li>
                            <li>Connecting the system to specialized hardware for dedicated performance. </li>
                            <li>Expanding the model into a complete self-sufficiency system that includes face and
                                traffic light recognition. </li>
                            <li>Adding a night vision mode to enable visual tracking in low-light conditions. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Conclusion & Key Takeaways</h2>
                        <p>Object detection is a fundamental capability for many modern applications, from consumer
                            electronics to advanced driving assistance systems. While the field has made incredible
                            progress, there is still work to be done to reach human-level performance, especially in
                            adapting to new environments. This project was a rewarding journey that solidified my skills
                            and left me excited to continue exploring the vast potential of computer vision. </p>
